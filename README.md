# bh199resurgence

This project is basically just a merge of the latest SlashDiablo beta bh 1.9.9 and Planqi's existing resurgence HideNothing config along with a few extra touches from various resurgence community members.

You will need to use at least BH 1.9.10 (BETA).  The bh.dll file provided here is up to date as of release 2.9.9 in BeLikeLeBron's repo.

# Installation
* Back up old bh files (bh.dll and bh_default.cfg for most everyone).  Place into a folder called "Old Bh" or something.
* Download 3 new files: bh.dll, bh.cfg, and bh_settings.cfg, place into d2 folder where bh files were previously
* Open d2 and play

# Tiers & Filter Levels
Check out Lebron's repo for more details on how the tiers, filters, and other new bh features work.  Make sure to ping Labarr for all support inquiries, epsecially if using with PlugY.
